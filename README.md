## Npm Commands

There are a few useful commands you can use during development.

```sh
# Run tests (and lint) automatically whenever you save a file.
npm run watch

# Run tests with coverage stats (but won't fail you if coverage does not meet criteria)
npm run test

# Manually verify the project.
# This will be ran during 'npm preversion' so you normally don't need to run this yourself.
npm run verify

# Build the project.
# You normally don't need to do this.
npm run build

# Run tslint
# You normally don't need to do this as `npm run watch` and `npm version` will automatically run lint for you.
npm run lint
```
